        Cleans a text file created from Capital One's Year End Summary converting it into a CSV ready to import
        into other applications.

        The flat file is created by manually cutting and pasting the tabular sections of data into a text file. The
        eventual line looks something like:

      desc "clean capital-one-statement", "Cleans a text file created from Capital One monthly statment"
      long_desc <<-LONGDESC
        Cleans a text file created from Capital One's monthly statement converting it into a CSV ready to import
        into other applications.

        The flat file is created by using docsplit to extract text from PDF statement and then manually formatting some
        lines.  The eventual line looks something like:

        149 12 JAN KIRKLANDS #685THE WOODLANDSTX     $40.68

        When --straddle-years[-s], the --year will be applied to the December transactions and the --year + 1 will be
